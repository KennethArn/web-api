# Giraf Backend

This repository contains the backend API for the Giraf Project. The API is a .net-core project written in C#.

## Build & Run

To run the project locally with a MySQL database first do the following:

0. Prerequisites:
  - Download and install .NET Core 2.1.101 SDK or a version backwardly compatible with it.
  - Download and install MySQL Server and optionally MySQL Workbench or another database manager.
  - Create a database named giraf on the MySQL Server. This can be done from the workbench or via cli.

1. Open a terminal-emulator and navigate to `â‹¯/web-api/GirafRest`

  - run `cp appsettings.template.json appsettings.Development.json`
  - update appsettings.Development.json with
	- All fields <> in the"DefaultConnection" string.
    - Jwt.JwtKey field, which must be any (random) string of, at least 40, alpha-numeric charecters
    - Jwt.JwtIssuer field, which is your name or organization. For example "Aalborg University"
  - run `dotnet restore`
  - run `dotnet ef database update`
  - run `dotnet run --sample-data`

The `--sample-data` flag will generate sample data if target database is empty, and we recommend using this flag by default. Other possible flags are:

        --prod=[true|false]		| If true then connect to production db, defaults to false.
        --port=integer			| Specify which port to host the server on, defaults to 5000.
        --list				    | List options
        --sample-data		    | Tells the rest-api to generate some sample data. This only works on an empty database.
        --logfile=string		| Toggles logging to a file, the string specifies the path to the file relative to the working directory.


Once the API is running locally you can navigate to `http://localhost:5000/swagger/` to see and tryout requests to the endpoints. We recommend keeping a text file with often-used DTOs and bearer tokens as part of your workflow.

3. (Optional) To login via swagger:
  - Make a Account/Login request with valid login-info (username: `Tobias`, password: `password`)
  - Copy the `data` field containing the token.
  - Click on the green Authorize button (Or the padlocks)
  - Write `bearer [your-token]` (note the space) in the input-field. 
  - Click Authorize and close the pop-up. 
  - You are now authorized and can make autorized requests.

## Migrations (Only for developers of the API)
If changes has been made to the model classes then a new migration should be added to be able to update the database without losing data:
  - In a shell, navigate to: `.../web-api/GirafRest`
  - `dotnet ef migrations add NameOfMigrationDescribingTheChange`
  - `dotnet ef database update`
  - If an exception is thrown then adjust the migration Up method in the file `Migrations/...NameOfMigrationDescribingTheChange.cs` to include the change of the model without triggering any MySQL exceptions. It may be good to inspect the file in any case, to see that it will function as expected.
  - When the database is updated confirm that the migration `NameOfMigrationDescribingTheChange` is added to the table `__efmigrationshistory` in the giraf database.
  - Now check that the Down method in the migration is also working properly. Determine the name of the last migration before yours, looking at the date and time prefixes in `ls Migrations/MySQL`. If it is `20180409123114_PreviousMigration.cs`, then you must run `dotnet ef database update PreviousMigration`.
  - If an exception is thrown then adjust the migration Down method in the file `Migrations/...NameOfMigrationDescribingTheChange.cs` to include the change of the model without triggering any MySQL exceptions.
  - When the database is updated to the previous migration confirm that `NameOfMigrationDescribingTheChange` is no longer in the table `__efmigrationshistory` in the giraf database.
  - Finally update the database to the newly added migration again using `dotnet ef database update`. 
  - If an exception is thrown adjust the Up method of the migration again to fix the issue. 

## Generate Client
Because the REST-API integrates swagger as middle-ware it is possible to generate a client-side API in your prefered language. To do so start up the REST-API navigate to swagger: `http://localhost:5000/swagger/` and copy the url to the swagger json file on the top of the side.

To make a client download swagger-codegen and navigate to the folder:

You can now generate a client side API in for example C# by running either of the following commands:
  - `java -jar modules/swagger-codegen-cli/target/swagger-codegen-cli.jar generate  -i http://localhost:5000/swagger/v1/swagger.json -l csharp -o Client/Generated/` 
  - `swagger-codegen generate -i http://localhost:5000/swagger/v1/swagger.json -l csharp`

## API Reference

For API reference start the API and navigate to localhost:5000/swagger

Descriptions are generated from method summaries etc. in the code.

## Admin Panel
The Admin panel is currently hosted together with the API and the login page is located at: `host/admin/login.html`
Through the admin panel it is possible to adminstrate users and departments of Giraf and different roles in the system has different functionality and access rights.
Note that it is possible to generate a reset link for users that you have access to. This link is intended to only work if accessed by an unauthorised user.
